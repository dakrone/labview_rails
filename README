Labview is designed to be a lab-machine tracking system for sysadmins.

I use it internally to track all of our lab machines.

NOTES:
Be sure to create databases, as well as add users. Currently there is no
way to add users other than opening a rails console and doing
User.new(<blah>).save!

Still a work in progress, email me or leave a comment in you have a
question about it.
